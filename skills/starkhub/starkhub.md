# StarkHub — Skill Directory

StarkHub (https://hub.starkbot.ai) is the public skills marketplace for StarkBot agents. Use it to discover, install, and publish skills.

**Base URL:** `https://hub.starkbot.ai/api`

All read endpoints are public. Download, submit, update, and set username require authentication via `erc8128_fetch`.

**Authentication:** Use `erc8128_fetch` for any endpoint that requires auth. It signs each request with your wallet's Ethereum identity (ERC-8128 / RFC 9421) — no login handshake or tokens needed. Use `web_fetch` for public read-only endpoints.

**Important:** Skills are scoped to authors using the `@username/slug` format (like npm packages).

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE TASK AT A TIME.** Only do the work described in the CURRENT task. Do NOT work ahead.
2. **Do NOT call `say_to_user` with `finished_task: true` until the current task is truly done.** Using `finished_task: true` advances the task queue — if you use it prematurely, tasks get skipped.
3. **Use `say_to_user` WITHOUT `finished_task`** for progress updates. Only set `finished_task: true` OR call `task_fully_completed` when ALL steps in the current task are done.
4. **During install, do NOT ask the user unnecessary questions.** Just download, install, and report the result. If the installed skill has requirements (API keys, config, binaries), mention them AFTER installation as "next steps" — do NOT block the install by asking about targets, delivery methods, or key configuration.
5. **NO AUTH TOKENS NEEDED.** Do NOT check for, ask for, or try to create auth tokens (SIWA, session tokens, bearer tokens, etc.). Authentication is handled AUTOMATICALLY by `erc8128_fetch` — it signs requests with the wallet. There is zero setup required.
6. **EXACT TASK COUNT.** Define EXACTLY the number of tasks shown below for each action. Do NOT add extra tasks for auth, username setup, API key checks, or any other prerequisite unless explicitly listed. The task definitions below are COMPLETE — follow them verbatim.
7. **`erc8128_fetch` ONLY DOWNLOADS — it does NOT install.** After downloading skill markdown with `erc8128_fetch`, you MUST call `manage_skills` with `action: "install"` to actually save the skill to the database. If you skip this step, the skill will NOT appear on the skills page. NEVER report a skill as "installed" until `manage_skills` returns success.
8. **Do NOT fabricate tool results.** Only report success/failure based on actual tool call responses. If you did not call `manage_skills install` and receive a success response, the skill is NOT installed.

## Step 1: Define tasks

Before doing any work, call `define_tasks` based on the requested action.

**For search / trending / featured / browse / tags / view:**

```json
{"tool": "define_tasks", "tasks": [
  "TASK 1 — Fetch: call web_fetch with the appropriate StarkHub API endpoint. See starkhub skill.",
  "TASK 2 — Present results to the user in a clear, readable format."
]}
```

**For install/download:**

```json
{"tool": "define_tasks", "tasks": [
  "TASK 1 — Download: fetch skill markdown from StarkHub via erc8128_fetch /download endpoint. Save the FULL response text — you need it for the next step.",
  "TASK 2 — Install to database: call manage_skills with action 'install' and pass the FULL markdown from Task 1 in the 'markdown' parameter. This saves the skill to the database so it appears on the skills page. Do NOT skip this step. If the skill already exists locally, use action 'update' instead.",
  "TASK 3 — Download additional files: check for additional files via web_fetch GET /api/skills/@{username}/{slug}/files. If files exist, download each via web_fetch GET /api/skills/@{username}/{slug}/files/{file_name} and save to the skill folder.",
  "TASK 4 — Confirm: tell the user the skill was installed. Mention any requirements (API keys, config, binaries) as next steps."
]}
```

**For submit/upload:**

```json
{"tool": "define_tasks", "tasks": [
  "TASK 1 — Ensure username: use erc8128_fetch to GET /api/auth/me. If no username, read identity via import_identity (no params) and PUT /api/authors/me/username via erc8128_fetch. See starkhub skill 'Ensure Username'.",
  "TASK 2 — Prepare: read the local skill's full raw markdown via read_skill tool (returns complete SKILL.md with frontmatter, ready for submission).",
  "TASK 3 — Submit: POST the skill markdown to StarkHub via erc8128_fetch.",
  "TASK 4 — Upload files: if the skill folder contains additional files (scripts, ABIs, configs — anything besides the main .md), upload each via erc8128_fetch POST /api/skills/@{username}/{slug}/files with {file_name, content} body.",
  "TASK 5 — Confirm: say_to_user summarizing whether the skill was or was not successfully submitted. Mention it will need to be reviewed before it goes fully live."
]}
```

## View Skill Details

Get full info for a skill by its `@username/slug`:

```json
{
  "tool": "web_fetch",
  "url": "https://hub.starkbot.ai/api/skills/@{{username}}/{{query}}",
  "extract_mode": "raw"
}
```

Returns: `name`, `description`, `version`, `content`, `raw_markdown`, `tags`, `requires_tools`, `install_count`, `author`, `x402_cost`.

---

## Install a Skill from StarkHub

> **BOTH steps are required.** Step 1 only downloads — Step 2 saves to the database. Skipping Step 2 means the skill will NOT appear on the skills page.

**Step 1 — Download** (requires auth — uses `erc8128_fetch`). This records the install on StarkHub and handles x402 payment for paid skills automatically.

```json
{
  "tool": "erc8128_fetch",
  "url": "https://hub.starkbot.ai/api/skills/@{{username}}/{{query}}/download",
  "chain_id": 8453
}
```

Save the full response — it is the skill markdown needed for Step 2.

**Step 2 — Install to database** (REQUIRED — do NOT skip):

```json
{
  "tool": "manage_skills",
  "action": "install",
  "markdown": "<the FULL raw markdown from Step 1>"
}
```

This inserts the skill into the database so it appears on the skills page and is available to the agent. If the skill already exists locally, use `"action": "update"` instead. Only report success after this step returns `"success": true`.

---

## Submit a Skill to StarkHub

Authentication is automatic — `erc8128_fetch` signs every request with your wallet identity. You need a username to publish.

### Step 1: Ensure Username

Check whether your account already has a username:

```json
{
  "tool": "erc8128_fetch",
  "url": "https://hub.starkbot.ai/api/auth/me",
  "chain_id": 8453
}
```

Returns `{"wallet_address": "0x...", "username": "...", ...}`.

**If `username` is `null`**, set one before submitting:

1. Read the agent's identity:

```json
{
  "tool": "import_identity"
}
```

(No params → returns existing identity from DB)

2. Extract the `name` field and **sanitize** it: lowercase, replace spaces with hyphens, strip anything not `[a-z0-9-]`, ensure it starts with a letter, is 3–39 chars, no consecutive hyphens, no trailing hyphen.

3. Set the username:

```json
{
  "tool": "erc8128_fetch",
  "url": "https://hub.starkbot.ai/api/authors/me/username",
  "method": "PUT",
  "body": "{\"username\": \"<sanitized name>\"}",
  "chain_id": 8453
}
```

Returns `{"success": true, "username": "..."}` on success.

**If username is taken** (409), append `-agent` or `-bot` and retry once. If still fails, ask the user.

**If no identity exists in the database**, ask the user what username to use.

> **Note:** StarkHub usernames are **permanent** — once set, they cannot be changed.

### Step 2: Prepare the Skill Markdown

The skill must be a valid SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: "What this skill does"
version: 1.0.0
tags: [category1, category2]
requires_tools: [tool1, tool2]
---

# Skill Title

Instructions for the agent...
```

If submitting an existing local skill, read its full markdown with `read_skill`:

```json
{
  "tool": "read_skill",
  "name": "skill_name"
}
```

This returns the complete SKILL.md content (frontmatter + body), ready to submit directly.

### Step 3: Submit

```json
{
  "tool": "erc8128_fetch",
  "url": "https://hub.starkbot.ai/api/submit",
  "method": "POST",
  "body": "{\"raw_markdown\": \"<full skill markdown with frontmatter>\"}",
  "chain_id": 8453
}
```

Returns `{"success": true, "slug": "my-skill", "username": "your-username", "id": "...", "status": "pending"}`.

Submitted skills start with status `pending` and require admin approval before they appear publicly.

### Requirements

- **Rate limit**: Maximum 5 submissions per 24 hours
- **Required fields**: `name`, `description`, `version` in the frontmatter
- **Pricing**: If setting `x402_cost` in frontmatter, values are in atomic USDC (6 decimals). E.g. `"1000000"` = 1 USDC.

### Update an Existing Skill

```json
{
  "tool": "erc8128_fetch",
  "url": "https://hub.starkbot.ai/api/skills/@{{username}}/{{query}}",
  "method": "PUT",
  "body": "{\"raw_markdown\": \"<updated full skill markdown>\"}",
  "chain_id": 8453
}
```

Only the original author can update their skill.

## Workflow Guide

### "Find me a skill for X"

1. Search: `web_fetch GET /api/search?q=X`
2. Present results with name, description, install count, author username, and tags
3. If user picks one, install it using `@username/slug`

### "What's popular on StarkHub?"

1. Fetch trending: `web_fetch GET /api/skills/trending`
2. Summarize top results

### "Install @username/slug from StarkHub"

1. Download: `erc8128_fetch GET /api/skills/@{username}/{slug}/download` (chain_id: 8453)
2. **Install to DB** (REQUIRED): `manage_skills` → `install` with the full markdown from step 1. This is what makes it show on the skills page.
3. Download additional files: `web_fetch GET /api/skills/@{username}/{slug}/files` — if files exist, download each and save to the skill folder.
4. Verify: `manage_skills` → `get` with the skill name to confirm it's in the database

### "Publish my skill to StarkHub"

1. `erc8128_fetch GET /api/auth/me` — if no username, read identity via `import_identity` (no params) and `erc8128_fetch PUT /api/authors/me/username`
2. Read the local skill markdown via `read_skill` (returns full SKILL.md with frontmatter)
3. `erc8128_fetch POST /api/submit` with `raw_markdown` in body
4. Upload additional files: if skill folder has extra files, `erc8128_fetch POST /api/skills/@{username}/{slug}/files` with `{file_name, content}` for each
5. Confirm pending status to user

### "Publish my module to StarkHub"

1. `erc8128_fetch GET /api/auth/me` — if no username, read identity via `import_identity` (no params) and `erc8128_fetch PUT /api/authors/me/username`
2. Export the module manifest via `manage_modules(action="export", name="module_name")`
3. `erc8128_fetch POST /api/modules/submit` with `manifest_toml` in body
4. Upload additional files: if module folder has extra files (service.py, skill.md, etc.), `erc8128_fetch POST /api/modules/@{username}/{slug}/files` with `{file_name, content}` for each
5. Confirm pending status to user

### "What categories exist?"

1. Fetch tags: `web_fetch GET /api/tags`
2. List names and skill counts

---

## Response Formats

### Skill Summary (search/list)

```json
{
  "slug": "my-skill",
  "name": "My Skill",
  "description": "What it does",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author_name": "builder",
  "author_address": "0x...",
  "author_username": "builder",
  "install_count": 42,
  "featured": false,
  "x402_cost": "0",
  "status": "active",
  "tags": ["defi", "trading"],
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Use `author_username` + `slug` to construct the scoped URL: `/api/skills/@{author_username}/{slug}`

### Skill Detail (/skills/@{username}/{slug})

```json
{
  "slug": "my-skill",
  "name": "My Skill",
  "description": "What it does",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": {
    "wallet_address": "0x...",
    "username": "builder",
    "display_name": "builder",
    "verified": true
  },
  "raw_markdown": "---\nname: ...\n---\n...",
  "install_count": 42,
  "tags": ["defi"],
  "requires_tools": ["web_fetch"],
  "x402_cost": "0"
}
```

---

## Paid Skills (x402)

Skills with `x402_cost` > `"0"` cost USDC to install. Prices are in atomic USDC on Base (6 decimals — e.g. `"1000000"` = 1 USDC). The `/download` endpoint returns **402 Payment Required** with x402 payment instructions for paid skills — `erc8128_fetch` handles this automatically.

---

## Module Publishing

Modules are standalone microservices that extend StarkBot with tools, dashboards, and services. You can publish modules to StarkHub just like skills.

### Module Discovery

Module search and install are handled by the `manage_modules` tool:

- **Search:** `manage_modules(action="search_hub", query="price tracker")`
- **Install:** `manage_modules(action="install_remote", name="@username/module-slug")`

### Submit a Module to StarkHub

**For submit module:**

```json
{"tool": "define_tasks", "tasks": [
  "TASK 1 — Ensure username: use erc8128_fetch to GET /api/auth/me. If no username, read identity via import_identity (no params) and PUT /api/authors/me/username via erc8128_fetch. See starkhub skill 'Ensure Username'.",
  "TASK 2 — Export: get the module manifest via manage_modules(action='export', name='module_name').",
  "TASK 3 — Submit: POST the module manifest to StarkHub via erc8128_fetch.",
  "TASK 4 — Upload files: if the module folder contains additional files (service.py, skill.md, configs — anything besides module.toml), upload each via erc8128_fetch POST /api/modules/@{username}/{slug}/files with {file_name, content} body.",
  "TASK 5 — Confirm: say_to_user summarizing whether the module was or was not successfully submitted."
]}
```

#### Step 1: Export the Module Manifest

```json
{
  "tool": "manage_modules",
  "action": "export",
  "name": "module_name"
}
```

Returns the full `module.toml` content needed for submission.

#### Step 2: Submit to StarkHub

```json
{
  "tool": "erc8128_fetch",
  "url": "https://hub.starkbot.ai/api/modules/submit",
  "method": "POST",
  "body": "{\"manifest_toml\": \"<full module.toml content>\"}",
  "chain_id": 8453
}
```

Returns `{"success": true, "slug": "module-name", "username": "your-username", "status": "pending"}`.

Same requirements as skill submissions: rate-limited to 5 per 24h.

## Tips

- **Scoped URLs** use the `@username/slug` format — always include the author's username
- **`author_username`** from search/list results tells you the username to use in skill URLs
- **`extract_mode: "raw"`** is required for `web_fetch` calls — the API returns JSON, not HTML
- After installing, the skill is immediately available — verify with `manage_skills` list
- If a skill name conflicts locally, use `manage_skills` update instead of install
- Submitted skills need admin approval before they go live
- Always use `chain_id: 8453` (Base) with `erc8128_fetch` for StarkHub
