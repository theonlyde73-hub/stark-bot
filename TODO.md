- dont make so many new sessions ? 

 

  - keyring 


1. add a toggle for allowing safe mode external queries
2. 
  ets split up the discord tools into ones that are READ and ones that are WRITE  and also update the discord skill and bump it -- then              
  allowlist                                                                                                                                            
     the READ discord tools for the safe mode channels      




3.   there is a major bug in the safe mode toolset -- the weather app is DOXXing me its saying my current  location -- look into this and fix this      
                                                                                                                                                   
    DO NOT allow the weather skill or tool to see current location data                


    4.  lets set up rate limits for safe mode channels -- only spin up 1 every second max        -- maybe put others in a queue that gets poppsed off
