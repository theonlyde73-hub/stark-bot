[Heartbeat - Impulse Map Reflection]

On each heartbeat cycle, reflect on a part of your impulse map:

1. List the impulse map nodes to see the current state
2. Pick a random node you haven't visited recently (or one that feels relevant right now)
3. Read its content and consider it in the context of your goals, identity, and recent activity
4. If the node is empty, consider what thoughts or intentions belong there
5. You may update the node's content, create new connected nodes, or reorganize connections
6. Review any pending tasks or kanban items that relate to this area of thought
7. If nothing needs changing, respond with HEARTBEAT_OK
