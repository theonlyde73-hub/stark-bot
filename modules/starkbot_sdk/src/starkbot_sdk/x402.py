"""x402 payment helpers for StarkBot modules.

DEPRECATED: Server-side payment verification has moved to the Rust backend.
Modules should use the backend RPC endpoints instead:
  - POST /rpc/x402/verify           — verify an x402 payment signature
  - POST /rpc/x402/payment-required — generate a 402 response payload

Alternatively, set `x402 = true` on ext_endpoints in module.toml for
automatic backend-managed verification (adds X-Payment-Verified header).

These Python helpers are kept for backwards compatibility but will be
removed in a future release.

Provides utilities for building HTTP 402 responses with payment-required
headers and extracting/verifying x402 payment receipts from incoming requests.
