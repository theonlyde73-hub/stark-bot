//! x402 Protocol implementation for pay-per-use AI endpoints
//!
//! This module handles the x402 payment protocol flow:
//! 1. Make initial request
//! 2. If 402 returned, parse payment requirements (including token metadata from `extra` field)
//! 3. Sign payment based on scheme:
//!    - "permit" (EIP-2612): Permit signature for facilitator to transfer tokens
//!    - "exact" (EIP-3009): TransferWithAuthorization for direct transfers
//! 4. Retry with X-PAYMENT header
//!
//! The token metadata (name, version, address, chain_id) is dynamically extracted
//! from the 402 response, allowing compatibility with any x402-enabled endpoint.
